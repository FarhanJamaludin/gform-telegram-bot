# gform-telegram-bot

This is a Telegram bot designed to receive data submitted from Google Forms and display the message in a private chat. 
It was created to help the admins of the Telegram Chat (UPTM Confessions) filter confessions from students.

When the bot receives data from the Google Form, it displays the message along with "Approve" and "Reject" buttons. 
The admin can decide what to do with the confession based on its content. Pressing "Approve" sends the message to the main channel, while pressing "Reject" prevents it from being sent there. 
This system helps to streamline the process of filtering and approving confessions.

Please note that this project is currently unfinished. In order to send data from a Google Form to a Telegram bot, you will need to set up a Google Apps Script for the Google Form. 
I have provided the script in the source code.
